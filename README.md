## AiCore Projects: Milestone Task documentation:
This repository contains milestone task which I have successfully executed and carefully recorded, to serve as form of revision guide to me and also a proof to showcase    my genuine intrest to improve my coding skills with the utimate goal of securing a career in Tech.
Although I am have an Engineering background; I am totally new to python and apart from some self motivated personal learning I have had no previous experiencve in coding with python. I am driven by enthusiasm and genuine passion to learn various software coding packages and hope to study and practice until I am able to comfortably teach others.
I hope you enjoy going through my work.
Thank you.
